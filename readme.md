[![shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ko--fi-Donate%20-hotpink?logo=kofi&logoColor=white)](https://ko-fi.com/stringweasel) [![shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=orange&label=Factorio&query=downloads_count&suffix=%20downloads&url=https%3A%2F%2Fmods.factorio.com%2Fapi%2Fmods%2Fconfigurable-valves)](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/configurable-valves)

Configurable valves for your fluids. Allows for overflow, top-up and one-way/check valves, just like Flow Control. Fully configurable with custom levels, as well as being connectable to the circuit network.

If you're instead looking for valves being different entities then have a look at [Valves](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/valves).

# Shortcuts (configurable)
- **Control + R**: Cycle between different default valve types.
- **Numpad +**: Increase threshold for overflow or top-up valves.
- **Numpad -**: Increase threshold for overflow or top-up valves.

# Compatibility

Should be comptatibile with most mods. If it's not compatible, please let me know.
    - **Pyanodons**: Will automatically migrate old Factorio 1.1 valves to their 2.0 counter part.

Other mods can also define their own configurable valves. TODO.

# Known bugs
- There is some weird fluidbox arrows being drawn at the moment. This is awaiting API changes to fix.
